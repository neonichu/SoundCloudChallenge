Having fun with the [SoundCloud][1] API.

The app runs on iOS 6 or later and uses [CocoaPods][2].

What does it do?

- Display results for a search, sorted by hotness.
- Flip animatio between waveform and avatar picture.
- Tap to open in SoundCloud app or on the website.
- Long-press to reveal cover art.

Acknowledgements:

- For used open source components, see Settings.app.
- DefaultAvatarImage by The Noun Project.
